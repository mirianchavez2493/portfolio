 <h2> Intro to Robotics <h2>
<p> My ideas of robotics have grown into a greater understanding, and knowing that there is code and structure in making your robot move. I am excited for future inovations such as robots delivering food or being able to help people with disabelities. I mast nervous for robots becoming to advanced to a point in wil hurt humans.<p>
<p> Making  circuts worked out because we could all work together to solve a problem, I wouldn't change a thing.<p>
 
 <h2> Dance party <h2>
 <p> Some basic pieces of Aurdino sketch are the board of education, bread board ,resistors, grounnd wires, and piezos only to name a few.<p>
 <p> I learned that circuts is a never ending loop, I did not know tehre where different types of circuts. My favorite part of the dancing robot was  watching the code run to the robot and makeing it move. <p>

<p> The MVC to me is model, view, concept best used as a base for reader imput that triggers a view. The difference between a framework is a collection of libraries that you use as an output. While libreary solves a specific problem, and function. To use a framework makes it easier to make an application, with allowing you the use of a template.<p>
   
   
  <h2> Blog Post <h2>
<p> I would like to be at the end of my Django Tuturial and understand what in detail what is ging on. I would like more practice in what to do if stuckin a problem, for example sertain steps/ actions to take, basics. I want to learn basic solving skills. I dont understand the point of doing all of those steps and what is it for is there a different way?Sometimes I get confused because of all the tabs used and sometimes confuse where to type in the code.<p>

   <p> Computers are good at data because it has been put into storage as reference. Making it more organized.An interesting fact about Reina Reyes confirmed Einsteins theory of Realativity.<p>
<p> FRom today I am most proud if figuring out how to insert binary code into csvin pythonn to atom. Dijkstra was most interesting to me because it showed how alternatively how set of networks work to get faster route to location.The algorithms used today compare to those of Alicia Abella because we both use the public key criptographyused to keep information safe iin the cloud.<p>
  <p> Objects made it even harder because there where more ting that confused me. I was proud when i understood what return did to my code.<p>
