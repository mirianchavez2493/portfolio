 <h4> Intro to Robotics <h4>
  <p> My ideas of robotics have grown into a greater understanding, and knowing that there is code and structure in making your robot move. I am excited for future inovations such as robots delivering food or being able to help people with disabelities. I mast nervous for robots becoming to advanced to a point in wil hurt humans.<p>
  <p> Making  circuts worked out because we could all work together to solve a problem, I wouldn't change a thing.<p>
 
 <h4> Dance party <h4>
  <p> Some basic pieces of Aurdino sketch are the board of education, bread board ,resistors, grounnd wires, and piezos only to name a few.<p>
  <p> I learned that circuts is a never ending loop, I did not know tehre where different types of circuts. My favorite part of the dancing robot was  watching the code run to the robot and makeing it move. <p>
