 <h2> Intro to Robotics <h2>
<p> My ideas of robotics have grown into a greater understanding, and knowing that there is code and structure in making your robot move. I am excited for future inovations such as robots delivering food or being able to help people with disabelities. I mast nervous for robots becoming to advanced to a point in wil hurt humans.<p>
<p> Making  circuts worked out because we could all work together to solve a problem, I wouldn't change a thing.<p>
 
 <h2> Dance party <h2>
 <p> Some basic pieces of Aurdino sketch are the board of education, bread board ,resistors, grounnd wires, and piezos only to name a few.<p>
 <p> I learned that circuts is a never ending loop, I did not know tehre where different types of circuts. My favorite part of the dancing robot was  watching the code run to the robot and makeing it move. <p>

<p> The MVC to me is model, view, concept best used as a base for reader imput that triggers a view. The difference between a framework is a collection of libraries that you use as an output. While libreary solves a specific problem, and function. To use a framework makes it easier to make an application, with allowing you the use of a template.<p>
   
   
  <h2> Blog Post <h2>
<p> I would like to be at the end of my Django Tuturial and understand what in detail what is ging on. I would like more practice in what to do if stuckin a problem, for example sertain steps/ actions to take, basics. I want to learn basic solving skills. I dont understand the point of doing all of those steps and what is it for is there a different way?Sometimes I get confused because of all the tabs used and sometimes confuse where to type in the code.<p>
